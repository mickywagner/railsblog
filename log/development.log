NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on.

Meaning it's time to go to the gym again. I've been going to the climbing gym pretty consistently since February when I lost my job. When you have no work, it's easy to workout. Now I have a sort of pathetic excuse for a job -- it takes up time anyways. So going is going to be tougher. \r\n\r\nBut I went today. It wasn't particulary good. I didn't make it up very many routes I wanted to hit. And for some reason it was really crowded -- wtf was everyone doing there at 3 p.m. Seriously don't you people have jobs? And the kids, there were so many kids. I'm okay with kids climbing, but some of the time they just take up all the space and are really oblivious to other climbers.\r\n\r\nI missed Wednesday gym day because we went PokÃ©mon raiding.
